      About Merciboq
    %p
      I've done a lot of jobs so far in life: Army infantryman, dump truck dispatcher, real estate agent, seller of advertising to lawyers. Maybe these weren't fancy jobs like being a lawyer, or a doctor, or a graduate student, but they paid the bills, and allowed me enough free time to write.  
    %p
      One of the more interesting of these jobs was that of commercial diver.  Not one of the fancy commercial divers with the science-fiction-ey-looking masks, tanks, and dry suits like Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss">The Abyss</a>, but one of the dirty, scruffy looking divers who work in your local marinas, and who jump into oil-scummy waters which other people have emptied their holding tanks into.

      I don't know if I was great at any of these jobs, but I did them as well as I could.  And I remember those occasions when one of my customers noticed. And so now that I'm working as a programmer, I thought it might be meaningful to build something like MerciboQ! that would allow me to try do for people in different jobs what those &mdash; special, good people &mdash; did for me. This is it.  I use it a couple of times each week to show my appreciation. Maybe I write a MerciboQ! about the fifth call center person I talk to at Verizon. Maybe it's the bartender who keeps me entertained, and who always knows what's best on the menu. His name is <a href="http://brad.merciboq.com">Brad</a> by the way.

      Or maybe it's my barber who works at Supercuts on the corner of Ashby and College in Berkeley, and who knows how to deal with my cowlick.  His name is Curtis Marsh.  Mayb it's the dry cleaner on Piedmont Avenue who makes me smile each time I pick up a coat, even if I left it with him six months ago.        
    %p Maybe for you, it's the salesman at Macy's who called three different stores trying to find five different sizes of the particular model bridesmaid shoe that your best-bridezilla-friend absolutely had to have for her wedding.

      Merciboq is about a) recognizing these people and b) giving them a way to stay in touch with their best customers.  All you need to do to send a MerciboQ! is get their email address and follow the instructions on the sidebar.  
    %p Thanks for reading.
